                <h2>A. Overview</h2>

                <p>Financial institutions operate in a fast-paced, complex environment with increasing risks to their
                    operations, notably their people, facilities, and systems. Robust operational risk management and
                    resilience enhance their ability to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from adverse events,
                    while continuing to deliver critical operations.</p>

                <h3>A1. Relationship between operational risk management and operational resilience</h3>

                <p>Operational risk management is about identifying and managing risks that could impact the operations
                    of financial institutions. The goal of operational risk management is to minimize the frequency and
                    intensity of disruptions and losses from those risks.</p>

                <p>Sound operational risk management is a cornerstone of operational resilience, enhancing the ability
                    of financial institutions to withstand disruptions. Operational resilience, however, assumes that
                    disruptions will happen. It focuses on the response of a financial institution and its recovery, by
                    taking a holistic approach that considers all critical operations end to end.</p>

                <h3>A2. Purpose</h3>

                <p>Sets expectations for managing operational risks and resilience.</p>

                <h3>A3. Scope</h3>

                <p>Applies to all federally regulated financial institutions, including foreign bank branches and
                    foreign insurance company branches, to the extent it is consistent with applicable requirements and
                    legal obligations related to their business in Canada. Expectations for branches are set out

                    <li>Explicitly set out risk limits.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Operational risk limits should typically be less than those established for tolerances for disruption
                    (see section 3.2).</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Risk and control assessments.</li>
                    <li>Key risk indicators.</li>

                <h4>2.3.1 Risk and control assessments</h4>

                <p>A self-assessment tool, such as a risk and control assessment, should be used to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Identify inherent operational risks.</li>
                    <li>Identify and assess associated controls to determine residual operational risks.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>A risk and control self-assessment or similar tool helps determine whether residual risks are within
                    operational risk limits. Where residual risk exceeds operational risk limits, the financial
                    institution should develop and implement action plans that include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Reviewing the appropriateness of operational risk limits.</li>
                    <li>Further mitigating the operational risk to the extent possible.</li>
                    <li>Explicitly accepting the level of operational risk exceeding operational risk limits.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Residual operational risks should be reassessed periodically, for example, when undertaking a
                    significant change (see section 4.4) or when there has been a significant operational risk event.
                </p>

                <h4>2.3.2 Key risk indicators</h4>

                <p>Key risk indicators are tools used to assess and monitor the main drivers of operational risk and
                    assess whether the financial institution continues to operate within its operational risk limits.
                    They may be developed using input from risk and control assessments (see section 2.3.1), operational
                    risk events (see section 2.3.3), and other sources. Key risk indicators should be in place at
                    various levels within the organization, including at the business unit and enterprise-wide levels.
                </p>

                <p>Key risk indicators may be either leading or lagging. Leading indicators are used to identify risk
                    exposures and emerging risks. Lagging indicators provide insight into control weaknesses. Both
                    should have escalation protocols to warn when risk levels approach or exceed limits. These warnings
                    should prompt management actions to mitigate the risks.</p>

                <h4>2.3.3 Operational risk event data</h4>

                <p>Operational risk event data exceeding established limits should be captured to assess:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>What the root cause of the operational risk event is.</li>
                    <li>Whether the operational risk event was actual, potential, or a near-miss.</li>
                    <li>What the underlying operational risk category exposures contributing to the event were.</li>
                    <li>What corrective measures ought to be taken to address deficiencies or control failures.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2.3.4 Scenario analysis</h4>

                <p>Scenario analysis identifies potential operational risk events, their impacts, control gaps, and
                    helps develop mitigating actions. It focuses on the sources of operational risk and exposure.
                    Scenario analysis should be conducted using appropriate techniques at both the business unit and
                    enterprise-wide levels and incorporate a range of severe but plausible scenarios.</p>

                <p>Scenario analysis should be an iterative process that becomes increasingly sophisticated over time.
                    The results of previous analyses, past events (internal and external), and near misses should be
                    considered in the design of future scenario analysis.</p>

                <p>Scenario analysis results may be used to inform operational resilience scenario testing (see section
                    3.3).</p>

                    <p><strong>Principle 5:</strong> Operational risks should be continuously monitored and reported to

                <h3>2.4. Monitoring and reporting</h3>

                <h4>2.4.1 Monitoring</h4>

                <p>Ongoing monitoring should be conducted to help prepare for, and respond to, changes in operational
                    risks. It should assess adherence to the operational risk appetite statement and operational risk
                    limits, as well as tolerances for disruption (see section 3.2). Monitoring should be risk-based,
                    with high-risk activities subject to greater scrutiny.</p>

                <p>Monitoring should be supported by comprehensive metrics. Operational risk management tools may be
                    used to support risk monitoring and identify any corrective measures.</p>

                <h4>2.4.2 Reporting and escalation</h4>

                <p>Reporting and escalation mechanisms should ensure senior management and the board of directors are
                    provided with timely reports and kept informed of significant concerns identified through the
                    operational risk management tools (see section 2.3). This includes where:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Significant issues and deficiencies are discovered.</li>
                    <li>Risk limits are approached or breached.</li>
                    <li>Residual risks are explicitly accepted.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Reports should include an aggregated assessment of risk profile that is current and forward-looking,
                    along with corrective measures.</p>

                <p>Senior management and the board of directors should also receive the results of scenario analysis
                    (see section 2.3.4) and scenario testing (see section 3.3). This should include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Analysis of deficiencies.</li>
                    <li>An assessment of operational resilience, and whether critical operations can be maintained
                        within established tolerances for disruption (see section 3.2).</li>
                    <li>Plans to address shortcomings.</li>

                <h2>3. Operational resilience</h2>

                <p>Operational resilience entails a sound understanding of critical operations end to end and their
                    delivery through severe but plausible circumstances within tolerances for disruption.</p>

                <p>While critical operations ought to be prioritized, over time, a mature approach to operational
                    resilience should include other operations that could have a significant impact on the financial
                    institution.</p>

                <div class="bg-info padded-sm">
                    <p><strong>Principle 6:</strong> Critical operations are identified and assessed, and internal and
                        external dependencies are mapped.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>3.1 Identification and mapping</h3>

                <p>Critical operations should be identified and assessed for their ability to withstand disruptions.
                    Assessments should be reviewed and updated regularly, including estimates of direct and indirect
                    financial losses due to disruptions.</p>

                <p>Once identified, critical operations should be mapped for internal and external dependencies.</p>

                <p>Mapping should:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>View critical operations end to end.</li>
                    <li>Consider people, technology, processes, information, facilities, third parties, and connections
                        or dependencies among them.</li>
                    <li>Focus on the activities that are needed to deliver the critical operations.</li>
                    <li>Identify vulnerabilities, which can inform scenario testing for operational resilience (see
                        section 3.3).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Where a third party is identified as critical, sufficient information should be obtained to assess
                    its resilience.</p>

                </div>

                <h3>3.2 Establishing tolerances for disruption</h3>

                <p>Tolerances for disruption should set out the maximum level of disruption a financial institution can
                    withstand across a range of severe but plausible scenarios.</p>

                <p>Tolerances for disruption are different and would typically be greater than risk appetite. Risk
                    appetite relates to the level of risk an institution would willingly accept to achieve its business
                    goals; whereas tolerance for disruption relates to the maximum disruption an institution can
                    withstand in a crisis.</p>

                <p>Tolerances for disruption should consider the impact of a disruption on:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Other critical operations of the financial institution that rely on the same resources.</li>
                    <li>Systems, facilities, and third-party suppliers on which critical operations depend.</li>
                    <li>Other financial institutions, the financial system, and the broader economy.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>When setting a tolerance for disruption, financial institutions should also be mindful that the use
                    of critical operations may vary at different times of day and throughout the year.</p>

                    <p><strong>Principle 8:</strong> Scenario testing should regularly assess the ability of critical
                        operations to persist through severe-but-plausible disruptions within established tolerances for
                        disruption.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>3.3 Scenario testing</h3>

                <p>Regular scenario testing improves understanding of when tolerances for disruption would be breached
                    (see section 3.2). This goes beyond operational risk scenario analysis, which identifies potential
                    operational risk events, their impacts, controls, and mitigating actions (see section 2.3.4).</p>

                <p>Scenario testing should include a range of severe but plausible scenarios, including concurrent
                    scenarios and those of longer duration. Examples include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Power outages.</li>
                    <li>Large-scale technology failures.</li>
                    <li>Critical third-party service disruptions.</li>
                    <li>Cyber incidents.</li>
                    <li>Natural disasters.</li>
                    <li>Health pandemics.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Scenario testing typically applies an end-to-end approach to determine the total impact across
                    multiple business units. It includes internal and external dependencies. Based on criticality, a
                    variety of testing methodologies should be used, including table-top exercises, simulations, and
                    live-systems testing.</p>

                <p>The business and central functions, risk and compliance functions, and internal audit or a similar
                    function may provide input and collaborate in the design and testing of scenarios.</p>

                <p>The financial institution should also coordinate with critical third parties, where possible, to
                    conduct broader exercises.</p>

                <p>The frequency and intensity of testing should be proportional to the criticality of and risk to
                    operations. Where there are significant changes in the risk environment, testing should take place
                    more frequently and outside the regular cycle.</p>

                <p>Scenario testing is iterative. It should become more sophisticated over time. The results of previous
                    tests should inform the design of future tests.</p>

                <h2>4. Key areas of operational risk management that strengthen operational resilience</h2>

                <p>Key areas of operational risk management that strengthen resilience include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Business continuity risk management.</li>
                    <li>Disaster recovery risk management.</li>
                    <li>Crisis management.</li>
                    <li>Change management.</li>
                    <li>Technology and cyber risk management.</li>
                    <li>Third-party risk management.</li>
                    <li>Data risk management.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This list is not exhaustive. As the risk landscape evolves, other emerging risk areas may play a
                    greater role in achieving operational resilience.</p>

                <p>Adhering to the expectations below contributes to outcomes one through three above.</p>

                <h3>4.1 Business continuity risk management</h3>

                <p>Business continuity risk management is the process of planning for, and recovering from, disruptions
                    to operations. It should be integrated with and strengthen operational resilience. Over time, its
                    focus should evolve from business processes to critical operations end to end.</p>

                <p>It should include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Conducting business impact analyses.</li>
                    <li>Developing and testing business continuity plans.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4.1.1 Business impact analysis</h4>

                <p>A business impact analysis assesses the risks and potential impacts of a range of disruptive events
                    on operations. It should identify and measure:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The impact of disruptions.</li>
                    <li>The maximum limits on recovery objectives before severe consequences or losses occur.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>It should be regularly reviewed and updated, as appropriate.</p>

                <h4>4.1.2 Business continuity plans</h4>

                <p>Business continuity plans set out the response and recovery actions for a range of potential threats.
                    They are designed to address disruptions related to people and physical assets, making sure they can
                    function quickly when disaster strikes.</p>

                <p>This should include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Establishing protocols for invoking the plan and making decisions.</li>
                    <li>Defining roles and responsibilities for managing disruptions.</li>
                    <li>Designating backup personnel to cover unexpected absences.</li>
                    <li>Implementing precautions to ensure safety of staff.</li>
                    <li>Setting targets for recovery levels and times.</li>
                    <li>Conducting business impact analysis, workarounds, and recovery strategies.</li>
                    <li>Developing internal and external communication plans.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Staff should be provided with training on business continuity plans, including their activation and
                    how operations will be managed during disruption.</p>

                <h4>4.1.3 Business continuity plan testing</h4>

                <p>Business continuity plan tests should provide reasonable assurance that plans are effective. They
                    should promote understanding among senior management and staff about their roles and
                    responsibilities in the business continuity plan and how operations will be managed during
                    disruption.</p>

                <p>Tests should consider a range of severe but plausible circumstances, including scenarios with
                    disruptions that:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Are long in duration.</li>
                    <li>Are simultaneous in nature.</li>
                    <li>Involve critical third parties.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The frequency and type of testing should be tailored to the results of business impact analyses and
                    align with the operational risk appetite. Critical third parties should also demonstrate robustness
                    in their own business continuity plans and testing. There should be processes to address gaps
                    identified during testing, as well as contingency plans for critical third parties.</p>

                <p>Business continuity plan testing should also inform scenario testing and contribute to an end-to-end
                    view of critical operations across the enterprise (see section 3.3).</p>

                    of technology infrastructure (for example, networks and data servers). The disaster recovery plan
                    should include roles and responsibilities and protocols for its invocation.</p>

                <p>For technology assets that support critical operations, failover and backup plans should be developed
                    and tested.</p>

                <h3>4.3 Crisis management</h3>

                <p>Effective crisis management helps keep employees safe, minimizes disruption, provides a timely and
                    coordinated response, and maintains public confidence in the financial institution. A crisis
                    management team can help ensure effective communication, expedited recovery, and an effective
                    response to the crisis.</p>

                <p>A crisis management plan should be established that ensures effective, coordinated, and timely
                    responses to potential crises from internal or external sources. It should include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Protocols for escalation to senior management and the board.</li>
                    <li>Criteria for invoking the plan.</li>
                    <li>Internal and external communications protocols for the timely sharing of information with
                        stakeholders.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Lessons-learned exercises should be undertaken following a crisis and incorporated into the plan. The
                    crisis management plan should be regularly tested and shared with the relevant business units in the
                    financial institution and any impacted external parties, as appropriate.</p>

                <h3>4.4 Change management</h3>

                <p>Change can create operational risk. Significant changes can include but are not limited to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Offering new products or services.</li>
                    <li>Engaging in acquisitions and divestitures.</li>
                    <li>Entering new markets.</li>
                    <li>Implementing new technological systems.</li>
                    <li>Significantly modifying business processes.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Comprehensive change management processes should be applied to significant changes, with operational
                    risks assessed and monitored. Processes should govern both the operational risks introduced by the
                    change, as well as the effective management of the change itself.</p>

                <p>Effective change management processes should align with the general expectations for operational risk
                    management set out in section 2.</p>

                <p>In addition, the financial institution should:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Adopt robust project management throughout the initiative's lifecycle.</li>
                    <li>Review and make any adjustments to operational risk appetite required because of the change.
                    </li>
                    <li>Deploy tested contingency plans in the event a change fails.</li>
                    <li>Test the change on systems and processes before introducing it.</li>
                    <li>Develop metrics to assess the post-implementation effectiveness of the change.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4.5 Technology and cyber risk management</h3>

                <p>A critical technology failure, infiltration, or loss of data can result in wide-scale disruption
                    impacting operations. Sound technology and cyber risk management is fundamental to bolstering
                    operational resilience.</p>

                <h3>4.6 Third-party risk management</h3>

                <p>Threats to operational resilience can arise from critical third-party arrangements, including
                    disruption at the third party or the loss or corruption of critical data. Accordingly, effective
                    third-party risk management is an important contributor to operational resilience.</p>

                <div class="well">
                    <p>Refer to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node"

                <h3>4.7 Data risk management</h3>

                <p>In an inter-connected and data-driven world, effective data risk management is an important component
                    of operational risk management and essential to operational resilience. Unavailable, poor quality,
                    or leaked data can hamper decision-making, disrupt critical operations, damage reputation, and
                    impact other financial institutions, the financial system, and the broader economy.</p>

                <p>This is particularly so for data that is:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Related to critical operations.</li>
                    <li>Needed for decision-making.</li>
                    <li>Personally identifiable.</li>
                    <li>Proprietary.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Effective data risk management ensures that data is accurate, complete, timely, secure, and
                    protected. Data risk management should align with the general expectations for operational risk
                    management set out in section 2. It should also comprise a specific data risk management framework
                    that includes a data risk management strategy and program.</p>

                <p>The data risk management program should include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Appropriate data governance, with clear roles and responsibilities.</li>
                    <li>A data architecture and information technology infrastructure that support the collection,
                        aggregation, tracing of lineage, and reporting of critical data across the enterprise.</li>
                    <li>Processes for classifying, aggregating, and protecting data.</li>
                    <li>Methodologies for ensuring the integrity, adaptability, confidentiality, and availability of
                        data throughout its lifecycle.</li>
                    <li>Processes for escalating and responding to data breaches and other data-related incidents.</li>
                    <li>Training programs for the people responsible for managing and overseeing data.</li>
                </ul>
