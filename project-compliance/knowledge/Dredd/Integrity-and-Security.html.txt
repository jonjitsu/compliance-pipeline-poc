                <h2 id="A">A. Overview</h2>

                <p>Public confidence in the Canadian financial system depends on the integrity and security of financial
                    institutions. To this end, the <a
                        href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/O-2.7/FullText.html" rel="external"><cite>Office
                            of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act</cite></a> includes a requirement for
                    OSFI to supervise financial institutions to determine that they have adequate policies and
                    procedures to protect themselves against threats to their integrity or security, including foreign
                    interference. Accordingly, financial institutions must take steps to ensure they are managing risks
                    associated with integrity and security by putting such policies and procedures in place.</p>

                <h2 id="A1">A1. Purpose</h2>

                <p>Set expectations for integrity and security and highlight related expectations in existing
                    guidelines.</p>

                <h2 id="A2">A2. Scope</h2>

                <p>This guideline sets out expectations for integrity and security policies and procedures. It is
                    applicable to all federally regulated financial institutions, including foreign bank branches and
                    foreign insurance company branches, to the extent it is consistent with applicable requirements and
                    legal obligations related to their business in Canada.<fn value="1">Foreign bank branches refers to
                        foreign banks authorized to conduct business in Canada on a branch basis under Part XII.1 of
                        the&nbsp;<cite>Bank Act</cite>. Foreign insurance company branches refers to foreign entities
                        that are authorized to insure in Canada risks on a branch basis under Part XIII of the
                        <cite>Insurance Companies Act</cite>.</fn> Expectations for branches are set out in <a

                        on Foreign Entities Operating in Canada on a Branch Basis</a>.</p>

                <h2 id="A3">A3. Application</h2>

                <p>This guideline applies on a risk basis, proportional to such factors as the institution’s:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Ownership structure, including parent-subsidiary or home office-branch relationships and
                        relationships with related parties and large shareholders</li>
                    <li>Business arrangements, including joint ventures and strategic alliances</li>
                    <li>Strategy and risk profile</li>
                    <li>Scope, nature, and location of operations</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Financial institutions should consider their susceptibility to undue influence, foreign interference,
                    and malicious activity when applying the expectations in this guideline.</p>

                <p>Where financial institutions face obstacles to meeting expectations in this guideline (for example,
                    local laws and regulatory expectations; limitations associated with leased premises), they should
                    understand the risks to which they are exposed and take appropriate mitigating actions.</p>

                    financial institutions, the following directly support integrity and security expectations:</p>

                <h2 id="1">1. Relationship between integrity and security</h2>

                <p>While integrity and security are distinct concepts and the outcomes of separate risk management
                    practices, financial institutions can enhance their security by acting with integrity. For example,
                    a lack of integrity can increase an institution’s vulnerability to physical or electronic security
                    threats. That is, failures to appropriately protect security are often rooted in failure to comply
                    with regulatory expectations, laws, or codes of conduct.</p>

                <h2 id="2">2. Policies and procedures</h2>

                <p>Adequate policies and procedures to protect against threats to integrity or security, including
                    foreign interference, must be established, implemented, maintained, and adhered to.</p>

                <p>Existing policies and procedures should be assessed against expectations in this guideline and
                    related guidelines. Effective monitoring, control, and reporting systems and procedures should be
                    developed and maintained. Any gaps or deficiencies should be identified, reported to senior
                    management, and addressed. The effectiveness of policies and procedures should be demonstrable and
                    assessed on a regular basis, including when the financial institution identifies new threats or
                    becomes aware of new information.</p>

                <h2 id="3">3. Integrity</h2>

                <div class="bg-info padded-sm">
                    <p><b>Outcome:</b> Actions, behaviours, and decisions are consistent with the letter and intent of
                        regulatory expectations, laws, and codes of conduct.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>

                <p>Integrity is demonstrated in actions, behaviours, and decisions that are consistent with the letter
                    and intent of regulatory expectations, laws, and codes of conduct. It is people within organizations
                    that take or fail to take actions and make decisions. Increasing the likelihood their behaviour
                    demonstrates integrity can be achieved in several different ways, including by:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Ensuring people are of good <strong>character</strong></li>
                    <li>Promoting a <strong>culture</strong> that values compliance, honesty, and responsibility</li>
                    <li>Subjecting actions, behaviours, and decisions to sound <strong>governance</strong></li>
                    <li>Verifying <strong>compliance</strong> of actions, behaviours, and decisions with regulatory
                        expectations, laws, and codes of conduct</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Integrity is an important value in and of itself. A lack of it can damage reputation, result in
                    fraud, cause legal issues, and increase vulnerabilities to undue influence, foreign interference,
                    and malicious activity. Creative compliance, regulatory arbitrage, and any other measures designed
                    to circumvent codes of conduct, regulatory expectations, or laws are not consistent with upholding
                    the intent of the law, regulatory expectations, codes of conduct and other relevant standards and
                    can jeopardize the integrity of the financial institution. Finally, financial risks often find their
                    root cause in failures of integrity. Thus, enhancing integrity reduces risks to solvency and
                    supports the overall safety and stability of a financial institution and, consequently, the
                    financial system.</p>

                <p>The way people behave depends to an extent on their character. Responsible persons and leaders who

                <div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>

                <p>Culture influences behavioural norms, which send signals throughout an organization about what is,

                    relating to management, compliance, risk taking, issue response, and learning and growth.</p>

                <p>Culture should be deliberately shaped, evaluated, and maintained. It should also be consistent with
                    the financial institution’s behavioural expectations of what is considered acceptable and
                    unacceptable. This said, there is no ideal culture; sound culture depends to some extent on context.
                    All cultures, however, should reflect a commitment to norms that encourage ethical behaviour.</p>

                <div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>

                <p>Sound governance subjects actions, behaviours, and decisions to appropriate scrutiny and challenge.
                    Effective governance builds trust with stakeholders, including shareholders, the public, employees,
                    and regulators; it provides a structured approach to managing important risks to the financial
                    institution.</p>

                <p>Accordingly, important decisions around business plans, strategies, risk appetite, culture, internal
                    controls, and oversight of senior management should be subject to effective governance.</p>

                <p>Oversight of senior management includes setting out responsibilities and providing for accountability
                    mechanisms.</p>

                <p>Behavioural expectations should be codified in normative documents such as codes of conduct and
                    conflict of interest policies and procedures. It is important to communicate expectations clearly to
                    employees, contractors, and stakeholders, including how non-compliance issues will be addressed,
                    resolved, and disclosed.</p>

                <p>Codes of conduct establish and communicate behavioural expectations, apply to all employees, and
                    include regular training.</p>

                <p>They should highlight the importance of:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Following the law, relevant regulatory expectations, policies, procedures, and processes</li>
                    <li>Avoiding conflicts of interest, such as bribery and other unacceptable influences</li>
                    <li>Maintaining objectivity and avoiding bias in decision-making processes</li>
                    <li>Ensuring security and confidentiality of assets, communications, and information</li>
                </ul>

                <p>They should cover the detection, disclosure, avoidance, and management of real, potential, and
                    perceived conflicts of interest.</p>

                <p>They should be assessed for effectiveness and reviewed and updated on a regular basis.</p>

                <p>Conformity with them, including conflicts of interest, should be monitored based on risk, considering

                <div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>

                <p>Compliance risk management is essential to maintaining integrity. It should ensure that compliance
                    can be accurately and expediently verified. It should also ensure that people have effective
                    channels to raise concerns over non-compliance with regulatory expectations, laws, and codes of
                    conduct. Compliance includes not just adhering to the letter of such requirements, but also
                    upholding their intent given the associated impacts on reputation and public trust.</p>

                <p>Appropriate compliance risk management includes establishing an effective, enterprise-wide Regulatory
                    Compliance Management (RCM) framework. This should accurately and expediently validate actions,
                    behaviours, and decisions against applicable regulatory expectations, laws, and codes of conduct,
                    both in letter and intent.</p>

                <p>An RCM framework should also provide effective internal channels to raise concerns and provide
                    constructive feedback: for example, through regular reporting and anonymous whistleblowing programs
                    internal to the financial institution. What constitutes effective internal channels depends on the
                    organization and its context. In all cases, channels should be regularly reviewed, updated, and
                    brought to the attention of employees. External channels to raise concerns, such as whistleblowing
                    programs run by government agencies or law enforcement, should also be brought to the attention of
                    employees.</p>

                        information are resilient and protected against threats.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>

                <p>Security includes protection against malicious or unintentional external or internal threats to real
                    property, infrastructure, and personnel (physical threats), and technology assets (electronic
                    threats). Such threats may arise from human error or be the unintended consequences of otherwise
                    benign activity. They may also result from undue influence, foreign interference, or other malicious
                    activity.</p>

                <p>Integrity helps to reduce vulnerability to threats. In other words, security is strengthened by
                    people with good character, a culture that is focused on sound governance and an appropriate and
                    well-established RCM framework.</p>

                <p>Sound operational risk management and operational resilience also reduce underlying vulnerability to
                    threats, particularly to threats that might disrupt operations. This said, some threats, especially
                    those arising from undue influence, foreign interference, or other malicious activities, may not
                    cause disruption. Non-disruptive threats may require additional methods of detection and prevention
                    to complement current operational risk management and operational resilience practices.</p>

                <p>Accountability for security cannot be contracted out. Services performed by third parties should be
                    subject to appropriate risk management measures.</p>

                <p>Policies and procedures governing all types of threats, internal and external, should be established
                    and maintained and consider threats associated with undue influence, foreign interference, or
                    malicious activity. They should be assessed for effectiveness, reviewed, and updated on a regular or
                    ongoing basis.</p>

                <p>The threat environment, including as it relates to third parties, should be assessed, and internally
                    reported at least annually, with security precautions implemented to protect physical premises,
                    people, technology assets, and data and information.</p>
