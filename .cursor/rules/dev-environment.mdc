# Development Environment Standards

## Shell and Terminal

- **Windows users must use WSL2 (Bash) for all development, scripting, and CLI operations.**
  - PowerShell is not supported for project scripts.
  - All scripts and commands should be run in a Bash shell within WSL2 for compatibility.

## Script Compatibility

- **All project scripts must be POSIX shell (Bash) compatible.**
  - If a script is not cross-platform, document it and provide a Bash version.
  - Avoid writing scripts that require PowerShell or Windows CMD.

## Tooling and Dependencies

- **Node.js 18+ (prefer 23+), bun, and bats are required.**
  - Install dependencies and run scripts using bun or npm as specified in the README.
  - Ensure your environment matches the versions and tools described in the project documentation.

## CI/CD Environment

- **All CI/CD scripts and workflows run in a Linux (Ubuntu) environment using Bash.**
  - Scripts must be compatible with this environment.
  - Test your scripts in a Linux/Bash shell before committing.

## Additional Notes

- Refer to the README for up-to-date instructions on setting up your development environment.
- If you encounter environment-specific issues, document them and notify the team.
