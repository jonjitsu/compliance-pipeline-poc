# Line Endings and Cross-Platform Compatibility

- All shell scripts (`*.sh`, `*.bash`), Python (`*.py`), TypeScript (`*.ts`), JavaScript (`*.js`), JSON (`*.json`), and Markdown (`*.md`) files must use Unix (LF) line endings.
- The repository must include a `.gitattributes` file at the root to enforce this policy.
- Contributors should not run bulk line-ending conversion tools (like `dos2unix`) on the entire repo; only convert files that are actually executed in a Unix shell if needed.
- CI and pre-commit hooks should check for correct line endings in scripts and code files.
- If a build or script fails due to line endings, fix only the affected file(s) and commit the change.
