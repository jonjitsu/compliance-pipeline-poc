                                    implementation and maintenance to disposal (NIST Special Publication 800-100).
                                    Software development methodologies (e.g., Agile, Waterfall) focus on a specific
                                    component of system development, whereas SDLC is a more holistic process for the

                            <h4>3.1.1 Security risks are identified</h4>

                            <p>FRFIs should identify current or emerging cyber threats proactively using threat
                                assessments to evaluate threats and assess security risk. This includes implementing
                                information and cyber security threat and risk assessments, processes, and tools to
                                cover controls at different layers of defence.</p>

                            <h4>3.1.2 Intelligence-led threat assessment and testing is conducted</h4>

                            <p>FRFIs should adopt a risk-based approach to threat assessment and testing. FRFIs should
                                set defined triggers, and minimum frequencies, for intelligence-led threat assessments
                                to test cyber security processes and controls. FRFIs should also regularly perform tests
                                and exercises, to identify vulnerabilities or control gaps in its cyber security
                                programs (e.g., penetration testing and red teaming) using an intelligence-led approach.
                                The scope and potential impacts of such testing should be clearly defined by the FRFI
                                with effective risk mitigation controls applied throughout the assessment to manage any
                                associated inherent risks.</p>

                            <h4>3.1.3 Vulnerabilities are identified, assessed and ranked</h4>

                            <p>FRFIs should establish processes to conduct regular vulnerability assessments of its
                                technology assets, including but not limited to network devices, systems and
                                applications. Processes should articulate the frequency with which vulnerability scans
                                and assessments are conducted. FRFIs should assess and rank relevant cyber
                                vulnerabilities and threats according to the severity of the threat and risk exposure to
                                technology assets using a standard risk measurement methodology. In doing so, FRFIs
                                should consider the potential cumulative impact of vulnerabilities, irrespective of risk
                                level, that could present a high-risk exposure when combined.</p>

                            <h4>3.1.4 Data are identified, classified and protected</h4>

                            <p>FRFIs should ensure that adequate controls are in place to identify, classify and protect
                                structured and unstructured data based on their confidentiality classification. FRFIs
                                should implement processes to perform periodic discovery scans to identify changes and
                                deviations from established standards and controls to protect data from unauthorized
                                access.</p>

                            <h4>3.1.5 Continuous situational awareness and information sharing are maintained</h4>

                            <p>FRFIs should maintain continuous situational awareness of the external cyber threat
                                landscape and its threat environment as it applies to its technology assets. This could
                                include participating in industry threat intelligence and information sharing forums and
                                subscribing to timely and reputable threat information sources. Where feasible, FRFIs
                                are encouraged to provide timely exchange of threat intelligence to facilitate
                                prevention of cyber attacks, thereby contributing to its own cyber resilience and that
                                of the broader financial sector.</p>

                            <h4>3.1.6 Threat modelling and hunting are conducted</h4>

                            <p>Where feasible, FRFIs should maintain cyber threat models to identify cyber security
                                threats directly facing its technology assets and services. Threats should be assessed
                                regularly to enhance the cyber security program, capabilities and controls required to
                                mitigate current and emerging threats. FRFIs should use manual techniques to proactively
                                identify and isolate threats which may not be detected by automated tools (e.g., threat
                                hunting).</p>

                            <h4>3.1.7 Cyber awareness is promoted and tested</h4>

                            <p>FRFIs should enable and encourage its employees, customers and third parties to report
                                suspicious cyber activity, recognizing the role that each can play in preventing cyber
                                attacks. FRFIs should create awareness of cyber attack scenarios directly targeting
                                employees, customers and relevant third parties. In addition, the FRFI should regularly
                                test its employees to assess their awareness of cyber threats and the effectiveness of
                                their reporting processes and tools.</p>

                            <h4>3.1.8 Cyber risk profile is monitored and reported on</h4>

                            <p>FRFIs should maintain, and report on, a current and comprehensive cyber security risk
                                profile to facilitate oversight and timely decision-making. The profile should draw on
                                existing internal and external risk identification and assessment sources, processes,
                                tools and capabilities. FRFIs should also ensure that processes and tools exist to
                                measure, monitor and aggregate residual risks.</p>

                            <h4>3.2.6 Security vulnerabilities are remediated</h4>

                            <p>To ensure security vulnerabilities are well managed, FRFIs should:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Maintain capabilities to ensure timely risk-based patching of vulnerabilities, in
                                    vendor software and internal applications, that considers the severity of the threat
                                    and vulnerability of the exposed systems;</li>
                                <li>Apply patches at the earliest opportunity, commensurate with risk and in accordance
                                    with established timelines;</li>
                                <li>Implement compensating controls as needed to sufficiently mitigate risks when
                                    remediation options are not available &nbsp;(e.g., ‚Äúzero-day‚Äù attacks); and</li>
                                <li>Regularly monitor and report on patching status and vulnerability remediation
                                    against defined timelines, including any backlog and exceptions.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>3.2.7 Identity and access management controls are implemented</h4>

                            <p>FRFIs should implement risk-based identity and access controls, including Multi-Factor
                                Authentication (MFA)<fn value="5">MFA uses independent authentication factors which

                                    &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt;, such as biometrics or behaviour.</fn> and
                                privileged access management. Where feasible, FRFIs should consider:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Enforcing the principles of least privilege, conducting regular attestation of

                                <li>Implementing MFA across external-facing channels and privileged accounts (e.g.,
                                    customers, employees, and third parties);</li>
                                <li>Managing privileged account credentials using a secure vault;</li>

                            <h4>3.2.8 Security configuration baselines are enforced and deviations are managed</h4>

                            <p>FRFIs should implement approved, risk-based security configuration baselines for
                                technology assets and security defence tools, including those provided by third parties.
                                Where possible, security configuration baselines for different defence layers should
                                disable settings and access by default. FRFIs should define and implement processes to
                                manage configuration deviations.</p>

                            <h4>3.2.9 Application scanning and testing capabilities are employed</h4>

                            <p>Where feasible, static and/or dynamic scanning and testing capabilities should be used to
                                ensure new, and/or changes to existing, systems and applications are assessed for
                                vulnerabilities prior to release into the production environment. Security controls
                                should also be implemented to maintain security when development and operations
                                practices are combined through a continuous and automated development pipeline (see
                                paragraph 2.4.2).</p>

                            <h4>3.2.10 Physical access controls and processes are applied</h4>

                            <p>FRFIs should define and implement physical access management controls and processes to
                                protect network infrastructure and other technology assets from unauthorized access and
                                environmental hazards.</p>

                            <p>FRFIs should ensure continuous security logging for technology assets and different
                                layers of defence tools. Central tools for aggregating, correlating and managing
                                security event logs should enable timely log access during a cyber event investigation.
                                For any significant cyber threat or incident, the FRFI‚Äôs forensic investigation should
                                not be limited or delayed by disaggregated, inaccessible or missing critical security
                                event logs. FRFIs should implement minimum security log retention periods and maintain
                                cyber security event logs to facilitate a thorough and unimpeded forensic investigation
                                of cyber security events.</p>

                            <p>FRFIs should maintain security information and event management capabilities to ensure
                                continuous detection and alerting of malicious and unauthorized user and system
                                activity. Where feasible, advanced behaviour-based detection and prevention methods
                                should be used to detect user and entity behaviour anomalies, and emerging external and
                                internal threats. The latest threat intelligence and indicators of compromise should be
                                used to continuously enhance FRFI monitoring tools.</p>
